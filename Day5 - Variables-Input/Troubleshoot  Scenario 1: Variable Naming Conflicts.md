### Issue:
Errors occur due to conflicts in variable names within the Terraform configuration.

### Possible Causes:

- Duplicate variable names in the same scope.
- Naming conflicts with built-in or reserved keywords.

### Solution:

1. Ensure each variable has a unique name within its scope.
2. Avoid using built-in or reserved keywords as variable names.
