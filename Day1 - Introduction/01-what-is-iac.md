# Chapter 1: Introduction to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Terraform

## 1.1. What is Infrastructure as Code?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a key concept in modern IT operations and cloud computing. It refers to the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable script files, rather than through physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

IaC treats infrastructure as software code, allowing you to define, version, and manage your infrastructure in a similar way to how software developers manage source code. This approach brings automation, consistency, and scalability to the deployment and management of infrastructure.

### Benefits of Infrastructure as Code:

1. **Automation:** IaC enables the automation of infrastructure provisioning, configuration, and deployment processes, reducing manual errors and improving efficiency.

2. **Consistency:** With IaC, you can ensure consistent and repeatable infrastructure deployments across different environments, leading to more reliable systems.

3. **Scalability:** IaC makes it easier to scale your infrastructure up or down based on demand, adapting to changing workloads more efficiently.

4. **Collaboration:** Since IaC is code, it can be stored, versioned, and shared using version control systems, promoting collaboration among team members.

Terraform, the tool covered in this tutorial, is a popular IaC tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language.

In the following sections, we will explore why Terraform is a preferred choice for Infrastructure as Code and delve into key Terraform concepts and features.
