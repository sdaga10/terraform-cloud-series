# Introduction - Interview Question

1. **What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and how does it contribute to modern IT practices?**

## Answer:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a key paradigm in modern IT practices that involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable script files rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. It allows IT teams to automate and standardize the process of infrastructure deployment, making it more efficient, scalable, and consistent.

### Key Points:

- **Automation:** IaC enables the automation of infrastructure provisioning, configuration, and management tasks, reducing manual errors and increasing efficiency.

- **Version Control:** Infrastructure configurations are maintained as code, allowing teams to use version control systems (e.g., Git) to track changes, collaborate, and roll back to previous states if needed.

- **Reproducibility:** With IaC, infrastructure setups are repeatable and consistent across environments, ensuring that development, testing, and production environments are identical.

- **Scalability:** IaC facilitates the easy scaling of infrastructure by defining resources and configurations in a scalable and modular manner.

In summary, IaC brings agility and reliability to the IT infrastructure, aligning it with software development practices and supporting the principles of DevOps.
