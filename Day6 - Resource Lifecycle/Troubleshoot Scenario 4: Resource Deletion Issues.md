## Issue:

Terraform fails to destroy a resource during a terraform destroy operation.

## Possible Causes:

- Dependencies preventing the resource from being deleted.
- External changes to the resource outside of Terraform.
  
## Solution:

1. Check the dependencies and ensure all dependent resources are destroyed first.
2. If external changes were made, update the Terraform configuration to reflect those changes or manually delete the resource.
