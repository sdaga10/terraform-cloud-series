## Issue:

During a Terraform apply, a resource fails to provision, and the apply operation is rolled back.

## Possible Causes:


- Incorrect or missing configuration for the resource.
- Insufficient permissions for the Terraform execution.

## Solution:


1. Review the Terraform configuration for the problematic resource and ensure all required attributes are correctly defined.
2. Check the provider documentation for any specific requirements or constraints.
3. Verify that the credentials used by Terraform have sufficient permissions to create the resource.
