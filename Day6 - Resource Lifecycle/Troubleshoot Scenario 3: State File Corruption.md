## Issue:

Terraform state file is corrupted or inconsistent.

## Possible Causes:

- External modifications to the state file.
- Concurrent access to the state file without proper locking.
  
## Solution:

1. Make sure only one Terraform operation is executed at a time on a specific state.
2. Use remote backends that support locking to prevent concurrent access issues.
3. If the state file is corrupted, restore it from a backup or recreate it.
