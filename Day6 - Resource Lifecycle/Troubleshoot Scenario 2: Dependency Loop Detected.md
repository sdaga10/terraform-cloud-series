## Issue:

Terraform reports a dependency loop during the planning phase.

## Possible Causes:

- Circular references or dependencies in resource configurations.

## Solution:

1. Identify the resources involved in the dependency loop by examining the Terraform plan or graph.
2. Modify the configurations to eliminate circular dependencies.
3. Consider restructuring the resources or using data sources to break the loop.
