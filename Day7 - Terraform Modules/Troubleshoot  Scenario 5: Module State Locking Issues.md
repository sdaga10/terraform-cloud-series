## Issue:

Issues related to state locking and concurrent access when using modules in a collaborative environment.

## Possible Causes:

- Lack of proper state locking configuration.
- Concurrent modifications to the same module by multiple users.

## Solution:

1. Use remote state backends that support locking.
2. Educate users on the importance of acquiring and releasing state locks during operations.
